# ebanking-commons

The ebanking-commons library contains central components and utility classes for microservices. The library does not contain any service specific code. 
It helps to create an uniform presence of all interfaces. Components that are automatically initialized by spring boot should be designed in such a way that 
they can be overridden by a micorservice if necessary.
